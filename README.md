# CRM Kickstarter

Used tech stack:

For web app 
 - Angular (typescript)
 - Fuse template from themeforest (should def take a look at their docs)
 
For server i used Google serverless and auth services i highly reccoment to switch to AWS as their services are painless to use and a lot more cheaper and flexible.
Google is like a light year back from AWS. The switch will consist of rewriting the lambdas which are tiny and basic.

Good luck.
